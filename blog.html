                        Although we returned a lot of people and thought we had good new recruits, we some how fell flat the whole season and ended

                with an impressive 3-9 record. Although our record was bad and we finished as the third worst team, we were better than that showing.
                Injuries and not trusting teammates plagued us the whole year. Even with those poor conditions, we still had a lot of close games. We lost a close 8-12 game in the second week. 
                After that we won two in a row which improved BYE WEEK to 2-3 in the year, although from there it went downhill, fast. We fell to Disc Jockeys, which had some old teammates, 7-9 in a close and hard fought game.
                After that lost to the eventually champions 4-9, which doesn’t sound bad until you hear they only had 5 people verse our full 7 playing on the field. The rest of the season was a blur with a lot of losses. 
                We ended our season in a close playoff game in which we had the disc on the last drive of the game, while down 1 point, and threw it away in the endzone to lose the game and end the season in a way no one was expecting.

                more excited were my parents, who were over the moon because they were now grandparents. Visiting Phin made me appreciate life so much as I held him and thought that at one point in my life I was just the same. A newborn brought into a loving family, yet in complete 
                dependance of my mother. God was so gracious to give us the gift of life and the ability to have a family in which we love. While I love being at Liberty, I also cannot wait to visit my nephew once again and see my family once again.

                    <p class="startText">Picture this: watching the sunrise as you're above the clouds. Sharp Top Mountain in Virginia offers just this. This hike was nothing new to me, I had done it once before when I was a sophomore at Liberty. Yet, it was so much</p>

                more enjoyable the second time around. The only downside was waking up to leave at 4am, but once we were there and started the ascent it became all worth it. The hike took nearly an hour and we arrived at the top right as the sun was coming up. We were greeted by others who had spent the night on top of the mountain in anticipation of the sunrise. 
                The view was at 3,375 feet is something to marvel at. The 360-degree view was full of countryside and other mountains, although not nearly as tall. Once the sun was up, we did what every college student who goes on a hike does, take way to many pictures. Once every picture combination was taken we sat 
                in silence and took in the creation of a powerful God. The sunrise hike is truly a unique experience that I believe everyone should go on at least once, even if they don’t like hiking. It was a wonderful trip I look back on very fondly. I would do it again if given the chance. The pain of waking up so 
                early as a college student and seeing the gas tank drop to empty is worth it for a special view.
