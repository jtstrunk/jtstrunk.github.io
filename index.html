        <p>
          I'm currently studying Software Engineering at Liberty University, but when I'm off my computer I love to play board games or be outside.
          Whether it's an outdoors activity such as going on a hike, backpacking, running, sailing, and rock climbing or playing sports like Tennis, Soccer, and Ultimate Frisbee.

          to select pacific of the game, such as: number of players, user inputted names, and different cards used.
        </p>
        <p>Munchkin Alternate Mode</p>
        <p>
          A web application built to facilitate the playing of an alternate version of rules for card game Munchkin. 
          The tool allows the user to select the number of players and enter custom names and a game length they want to play. 
          Once the game is started a random timer is set based on chosen game length.

      <h2>Navigation</h2>
      <p>
        You are on my home page. To the north lies <a href="/blog">my blog</a>, from
        whence the sounds of battle can be heard. To the east you can see a large
        mountain, upon which many <a href="/school">school papers</a> are littered.
        Far up thus mountain you can spy a little figure who appears to be me,
        desperately scribbling a <a href="/school/thesis">thesis</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the west are several exits. One fun-looking exit is labeled
        <a href="https://games.example.com/">"games"</a>. Another more
        boring-looking exit is labeled <a href="https://isp.example.net/">ISPâ„¢</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the south lies a dark and dank <a href="/about">contacts page</a>.
        Cobwebs cover its disused entrance, and at one point you see a rat run
        quickly out of the page.
