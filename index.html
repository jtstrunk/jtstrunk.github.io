        <p id="about">
          I'm currently a Junior studying Computer Science with a cognate in Software Engineering at Liberty University
          but when I'm off my computer I love to play board games or be outside -- whether going on a hike, backpacking, running, sailing, and rock climbing or playing outdoor sports; my favorites being tennis, soccer, and ultimate frisbee.

        <p>Dominion Score Counter</p>
        <p>
          A score tracking web application built to be used during a game of the popular deck building card game Dominion. Starting with a menu, the user is able to select specifics of the game: number of players, player names, and tailored cards used in a game. Once the specifics are chosen, individual score counters are created for each user.

        <p>Munchkin Alternate Mode</p>
        <p>
          A web application built to facilitate playing an alternate version of rules for the card game Munchkin. This tool allows the user to select the number of players, enter custom player names, and select a desired game length range. Once the game is started, a timer is set within the selected range and the user is provided with a level tracker to show the winner once the timer ends.

      <h2>Navigation</h2>
      <p>
        You are on my home page. To the north lies <a href="/blog">my blog</a>, from
        whence the sounds of battle can be heard. To the east you can see a large
        mountain, upon which many <a href="/school">school papers</a> are littered.
        Far up thus mountain you can spy a little figure who appears to be me,
        desperately scribbling a <a href="/school/thesis">thesis</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the west are several exits. One fun-looking exit is labeled
        <a href="https://games.example.com/">"games"</a>. Another more
        boring-looking exit is labeled <a href="https://isp.example.net/">ISPâ„¢</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the south lies a dark and dank <a href="/about">contacts page</a>.
        Cobwebs cover its disused entrance, and at one point you see a rat run
        quickly out of the page.
