                <p>A web application built to select certain cards from the popular card game Dominion. Selecting different filters will show a different set of cards depending on whether a card matches under the card type or category.</p>
                <!-- <p>Once the menu is finished the user is shown a number of counters, based of off number of players, each with a score counter so that players can easily identify who is winning at a glance. Along with the total Victory Point counter there are seperate subcounters for the each type of card that was selected to be in the kingdom. These increase, or decrease, the player's score by the correct number of Victory Points.</p> -->
